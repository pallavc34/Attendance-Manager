This is an Attendance Management System prepared for Theem College of Engineering as a part of Android Project in 3rd Year of Information Technology Engineering. 
This project is only available for Android platforms as of now and will run on all versions of Android above 4.4. The database backend of the app will need to be implemented on your server
separately. There are 4 tables that will need to be implemented at the backend of the server. 
Table 1 : Subjects
Table 2 : Teachers
Table 3 : Departments
Table 4 : Attendance.
The app will need to be configured with registration and login details inside login activity and register activity with your concerned database.

Only a teacher of the specific department is able to take attendance of the students of that department.
You also have an option to download a monthly report of the attendance taken by the teacher.
